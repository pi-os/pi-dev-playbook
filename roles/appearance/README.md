# Appearance Settings for Raspberry Pi

This role modifies some appearance settings on the Raspberry Pi to my liking.

## Changing the GTK 3.0 Theme

This role attempts to switch the GTK 3.0 theme, but it seems to not be able to apply the change on the fly.

So, to change the theme manually, run `lxappearance` and then choose 'Adwaita-dark'. Sigh.
